No matter what role I have had or where I have worked, one thing that has stuck
with me is the idea that project teams within a company are working on different
problems but approaching these challenges with similar methods and tools. Since
teams are using similar approaches, these teams will very often face similar
challenges regardless of what they are working towards.

The true challenge comes in how to easily share ideas and practices across a large
company. Additionally, helping teams be conscious that, despite different business
requirements, other development teams within their company typically use very similar
development practices and frameworks that should allow for standards to be created
and easily shared across projects can be difficult.

It's frustrating in an environment like that knowing that someone or a team within
your company knows how to do what you are struggling with, but feeling like you
can't easily find who to talk to and how to ultimately solve your project's issues.

In working with OpenShift, I have found the OpenShift Developer Catalog helps address
some of the concerns I raised above. The OpenShift Developer Catalog is a way to
centralize reusable practices for a development teams working with OpenShift.

When logging into the OpenShift 4 web console, you will find the Developer Catalog
on the left hand side of your screen under the `Catalog` tab:
